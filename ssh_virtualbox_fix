desc: Problem when windows 10 client trying to ssh into ubuntu server in hypervisor(Oracle VirtualBox)

- fix:
  - In the VirtualBox Manager inside the server settings, change the Network from "NAT" to "Bridged Adapter".
  
  - Make sure windows features "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and "Telnet" is checked
  
  - Make sure in windows services "OpenSSH Authentication Agent" and "OpenSSH SSH server" status is "running"
